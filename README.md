# Visionary Password Manager
A smarter password manager.

Conventional password managers have many flaws. They work by first generating strong, random, passwords; encrypting them with a master password; and then storing the encrypted passwords somewhere for later retrieval. Sometimes, the encrypted data can be synced other devices for ease of access.

There are a few problems with this approach:

1. The encrypted data can be lost thereby locking the user out of all of their accounts.
2. The encrypted data can be stolen. If the user was using a weak master password, all of their accounts can be compromised.
3. The data can only be synced to a limited number of devices.

**Visionary Password Manager** improves on these shortcomings considerably:

1. Your passwords are on-the-fly based on a pure algorithm. This means that the only thing that would make you lose your data is if you forget your master password.
2. Nothing is stored so there's nothing to steal.
3. There are thousands of iterations, which makes bruteforcing infeasable.
4. No need to sync data, as there's nothing to sync! You can use this script or our API (coming soon) from anywhere to generate your passwords.
